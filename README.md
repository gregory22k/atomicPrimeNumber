# atomicPrimeNumber

Determine if a prime number is not equal to a smaller number, increased by the sum of its digits

For example 1597 is prime (divisible only by 1 and itself) but it is not atomic prime since 1577 + 1 + 5 + 7 + 7 == 1597

Another example is 31, which is atomic prime since it is prime but no number exists that equals 31, if the sum of its digits is added to it.
